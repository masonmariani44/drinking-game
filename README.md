# random-timer
silly little game. sets a random timer in a given time interval. timer automatically resets when the last finishes and picks a new random time.

Run using latest version of python. Only garunteed to work on windows

Please note: 
When running in the terminal, the timer can freeze because of the sleep() function used. To fix this, right click on the terminal you're using and go to properties and uncheck QuickEdit Mode.
